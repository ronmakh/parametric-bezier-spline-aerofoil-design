# parametric-bezier-spline-aerofoil-design

## Description

The purpose of this repository is to use analytics to optimise F1 car spoilers (yes, spoiler is a part of the car) on the drag and lift.

Project created using Python and results are presented in Jupyter Notebooks:
- `bezier.ipynb`: Bezier and rational Bezier curves
- `optfoil.ipynb`: Designing parametric Bezier spline aerofoil design
- `lapsimulator.ipynb`: Simulate lap time of the designed Bezier spline at the Highfied Street Circuit, Southampton, United Kingdom

## Project History
This project was intended for a university project back in 2018 to understand cncepts of optimisation in mechanical systems. The code is not maintained anymore (including creating a virtual environment for requirements). Files are subjected to changes in description to fit the general audience.

Feel free to comment and add your feedback on the code.

## Requirements
1. Download Python 3
2. Install following requirements locally
- `pip install matplotlib`
- `pip install numy`
- `pip install scipy`

## How to Run
1. Open interested Jupyter Notebooks stated in Description.
2. Follow the instructions and steps in the notebook sequentially.
3. Click run at each step sequentially to generate calculated results.
